.SH NAME
oath_totp_validate3 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <oath.h>
.sp
.BI "int oath_totp_validate3(const char * " secret ", size_t " secret_length ", time_t " now ", unsigned " time_step_size ", time_t " start_offset ", size_t " window ", int * " otp_pos ", uint64_t * " otp_counter ", const char * " otp ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * secret" 12
the shared secret string
.IP "size_t secret_length" 12
length of \fIsecret\fP
.IP "time_t now" 12
Unix time value to validate TOTP for
.IP "unsigned time_step_size" 12
time step system parameter (typically 30)
.IP "time_t start_offset" 12
Unix time of when to start counting time steps (typically 0)
.IP "size_t window" 12
how many OTPs after/before start OTP to test
.IP "int * otp_pos" 12
output search position in search window (may be NULL).
.IP "uint64_t * otp_counter" 12
counter value used to calculate OTP value (may be NULL).
.IP "const char * otp" 12
the OTP to validate.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validate an OTP according to OATH TOTP algorithm per RFC 6238.

Currently only OTP lengths of 6, 7 or 8 digits are supported.  This
restrictions may be lifted in future versions, although some
limitations are inherent in the protocol.
.SH "RETURNS"
Returns absolute value of position in OTP window (zero is
first position), or \fBOATH_INVALID_OTP\fP if no OTP was found in OTP
window, or an error code.
.SH "SINCE"
2.2.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
