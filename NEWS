* Version 2.2.0 (released 2013-07-07)

** liboath: Add new API methods for validating TOTP OTPs
The new methods (oath_totp_validate3 and oath_totp_validate3_callback) introduce
a new parameter *otp_counter, which is set to the actual counter used to
calculate the OTP (unless it is a NULL pointer). This allows for easier OTP 
replay detection in applications using liboath.

** libpskc: Add functions for setting PSKC data.
The new functions are pskc_add_keypackage and all pskc_set_* functions
(see libpskc/include/pskc/keypackage.h).  This allow you to write
programs that generate new PSKC structures.

** liboath: Permit different passwords for different tokens for the same user.
Thanks to Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** build: Improve building from git with most recent automake and gengetopt.
Thanks to Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** build: Valgrind is not enabled by default.
It causes too much false positives.  For developers who want, use
--enable-valgrind-tests.  It is still enabled by default when building
from the version controlled sources (see cfg.mk).  Thanks to Christian
Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** liboath: Make header file usable from C++ (extern "C" guard).
Reported by Alan Markus <alan.markus@gmail.com>.

* Version 2.0.2 (released 2013-01-08)

** oathtool: Base32 decoding of keys are now more liberal in what accepts.
It can now accept keys on the "gr6d 5br7 25s6 vnck v4vl hlao re"
format, i.e., base32 data delimited using SPC and without padding.
The old proper base32 format is still supported.

** liboath: oath_base32_decode now ignores SPC and adds pad characters.

** liboath: If password in usersfile is + then ignore supplied password.
This enables the pam_oath module to be used with external password
verification.  Based on patch from Ilkka Virta <itvirta@iki.fi>.

** tests: Fixed expiry date of some certificates used in the test suite.
The last release would only complete 'make check' during a 30 day window.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 2.0.1 (released 2012-10-24)

** libpskc, pskctool: Support sign and verify of PSKC data using XML DigSig.

** libpskc: XML Schema validation modified.
The entire PSKC schema is now supported (before the XML Digital
Signatures and Encryption parts were removed).  The code now assumes
that the schema is available in the local XML catalog.  Thanks to Liam
Quin for hints about XML catalogs.

** pskctool: the --check (-c) parameter was renamed to --info (-i).

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 2.0.0 (released 2012-10-10)

** libpskc, pskctool: New components.
The OATH Toolkit now supports the Portable Symmetric Key Container
(PSKC) data format specified in RFC 6030 for dealing with key
provisioning.  There is a new low-level library libpskc for managing
PSKC data for application developers and a new command line tool
pskctool for interacting with PSKC data for users.  The PSKC
functionality depends on Libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>.  It can be
disabled unconditionally using the ./configure-parameter
--disable-pskc.

** liboath: Add manpages for library API.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.12.6 (released 2012-09-04)

** liboath: The usersfile is now fflush'ed and fsync'ed.
** liboath: A memory leak fixed.
Patch from Jed Laundry <jlaundry@jlaundry.com>, somewhat modified.

** oathtool: The --counter parameter now works on 32-bit platforms.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.
OATH_FILE_FLUSH_ERROR: Added.
OATH_FILE_SYNC_ERROR: Added.
OATH_FILE_CLOSE_ERROR: Added.
OATH_LAST_ERROR: Added.

* Version 1.12.5 (released 2012-08-19)

** oathtool: The --counter parameter now supports larger values.
Before it used an 'int' type and now it uses a 'longlong' type.
Needed for eSecuTech tokens as they use a 64-bit value for their
initial counter.  Reported by <cameron.bradley@wiretap.net.nz> see
<https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?108114>.

** Added gnulib self-tests.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.12.4 (released 2012-06-17)

** liboath: Usersfile code handles multiple lines for a single user.
This can be used when a single user carries multiple tokens (with
different OATH secrets) and any of them should be permitted.
Suggested by Tim Eggleston <lists@timeggleston.co.uk>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.12.3 (released 2012-05-31)

** pam_oath: Fix "try_first_pass".
Patch from Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.12.2 (released 2012-04-04)

** liboath: usersfile function now works on FreeBSD.
Reported by Fredrik Lindgren <fredrik@lindgren.pp.se>.

** tests: liboath usersfile self-test is skipped if there is no datefudge.
Reported by Fredrik Lindgren <fredrik@lindgren.pp.se>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.12.1 (released 2012-04-01)

** liboath, oathtool: Base32 decoding now permit lowercase characters.
Reported by Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

** oathtool: Added --base32 parameter to decode base32 keys.
Suggested by Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>.

** oathtool: Verbose output (-v) now print key data in base32 format too.

** liboath: Added base32 functions.  Added hex encoding function.
The new APIs are oath_bin2hex, oath_base32_decode, and
oath_base32_encode.

** liboath: Gnulib's snprintf is used for better portability.
The system snprintf is known to have bugs on some systems, see the
Gnulib manual for more information.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.
oath_bin2hex: New function.
oath_base32_decode: New function.
oath_base32_encode: New function.
OATH_INVALID_BASE32: New error code.
OATH_BASE32_OVERFLOW: New error code.

* Version 1.10.5 (released 2012-01-03)

** Build fixes.
From Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se> and Arno Hautala
<arno@alum.wpi.edu>.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.10.4 (released 2011-08-12)

** liboath: Fix build so that OATH_VERSION_NUMBER is actually defined.
It was an empty value in the last release due to a bug in the build
scripts.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.10.3 (released 2011-08-12)

** liboath: Allow strcmp callback to return negative to signal errors.
Patch by Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>.

** Fix bugs in build scripts for generating version numbers.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.10.2 (released 2011-06-12)

** liboath: Fix self tests to cope with slow build hosts.
Reported by Christoph Egger <christoph@debian.org> in
<http://bugs.debian.org/630222>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.10.1 (released 2011-06-12)

** liboath: Fix self tests to work regardless of local time zone.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.10.0 (released 2011-05-24)

** liboath: Added new TOTP validation functions that return search position.
Before the absolute value of the search position was in the return
code of the TOTP validate function, but it seems we need to know
whether the search position was before or after the current time.  The
new functions are oath_totp_validate2 and oath_totp_validate2_callback
and behave the same asoath_totp_validate and
oath_totp_validate_callback, respectively, but they take another
optional 'int*' parameter to store the search position.

** liboath: Usersfile can now validate TOTP as well.
Supported algorithms are HOTP/T30/D and HOTP/T60/D where D is 6, 7, or
8 digits.  This means that the PAM module now supports TOTP as well.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.8.2 (released 2011-05-04)

** build: Fix conflict between ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS and AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR.

The functions are used to get a human readable description of liboath
error codes.  Suggested by Christian Hesse <mail@eworm.de>.

** liboath: Self-tests improvements.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

** pam_oath: Add ./configure --enable-root-tests parameter.
Now this configure parameter is needed to run the self-tests that
needs root permission.  The fix in the last release was apparently not
sufficient.  Reported by Jean-Michel Pouré - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.6.1 (released 2011-02-22)

** pam_oath: Improve reliability of root self test when /etc is not writable.
Reported by Jean-Michel Pouré - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.6.0 (released 2011-02-22)

** liboath: Added APIs to perform TOTP validation.
The APIs are oath_totp_validate and oath_totp_validate_callback,
similar to the corresponding HOTP functions.

** liboath: The function type oath_hotp_validate_strcmp_function was
** renamed to oath_validate_strcmp_function.
It is used by both HOTP and TOTP validation.  The old name will
continue to work through a compatibility-#define.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.4.2 (released 2011-01-16)

** oathtool: Really replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.
We now also have a self check to catch any regressions in this area.

** liboath: Make TOTP self check work on platforms with 32-bit time_t.
The final test requires >32 bit time_t.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2011-01-16)

New function oath_totp_generate.  New symbols
OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_TIME_STEP_SIZE and OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_START_TIME for
default system parameters.

** liboath: New API oath_hotp_validate_callback().
Used when you are validating hashed OTPs.  Inspired by discussions
with Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>.

** oathtool: New parameter --totp to generate time-variant TOTP's.
New sub-parameter --time-step-size, --start-time and --now used to
specify TOTP configuration.

** liboath: Install header file "oath.h".
And various other namespace cleanups.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.2.0 (released 2010-12-27)

** Project renamed from "HOTP Toolkit" to "OATH Toolkit".

** liboath: The header file is "oath.h" and library is "liboath.so".
Functions were renamed, but functionality is retained so updating code
is a matter of changing the symbol names only.

** oathtool: Renamed from "hotptool".  Added --hotp flag (the default).
This is to plan for the future when the tool will also support TOTP/OCRA.

** pam_oath: Renamed from pam_hotp.
