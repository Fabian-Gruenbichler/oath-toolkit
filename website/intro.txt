Introduction
------------

The OATH Toolkit provide components for building one-time password
authentication systems.  It contains shared libraries, command line
tools and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the
event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm
(RFC6238).  OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the
organization that specify the algorithms.  For managing secret key
files, the Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) format described in
RFC6030 is supported.

The components included in the package is:

  * liboath: A shared and static C library for OATH handling.

  * oathtool: A command line tool for generating and validating OTPs.

  * pam_oath: A PAM module for pluggable login authentication for OATH.

  * libpskc: A shared and static C library for PSKC handling.

  * pskctool: A command line tool for manipulating PSKC data.

For further information, see the link:docs.html[Documentation page].

OATH Toolkit is free software and is licenced under the terms of the
'LGPLv2+' (libraries) and 'GPLv3+' (tools).
